# Create a program with the following:
# A.
# 1. Create a variable name first with value 7.
# 2. Create a variable name second with value 44.3.
# 3. Print result of adding first to second.
# 4. Print result of multiplying first by second
# 5. Print result of dividing second by first

first = 7
second = 44.3
sum = first + second
print("the sum is: ", sum)

mul = first * second
print("the multiple is: ", mul)

dev = second / first
print("the result is: ", dev)

#B

a = 8
a = 17
a = 9
b = 6
c = a + b
b = c + a
b = 8

print(a) #a = 9


#C
name = "john"
name2 = 'john'

print(name)
print(name2)

#no different unless you want to use " in the stirng

my_number = 5 + 5
print("result is: ", + my_number)

#missing ,

#D

x = 5
y = 2.36

print(x + int(y))

#the output is 7 since we take only the int of y (2)

#Challenge
a = 8
b = "123"

print(a + int(b))
